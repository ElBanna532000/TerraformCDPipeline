Welcome to our Terraform Infrastructure Automation project! This repository aims to provide you with a comprehensive guide and resources to create and manage infrastructure using Terraform while automating the deployment process with GitHub Actions.

What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can define your infrastructure components such as virtual machines, databases, and networks in a configuration file, and Terraform will manage the provisioning process for you.

What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) platform provided by GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code or infrastructure changes based on various triggers, such as pushes, pull requests, or schedules.

How does this project help?
This project combines the capabilities of Terraform and GitHub Actions to streamline the process of defining infrastructure as code and automating its deployment. Here's what you can achieve with this project:

Define Infrastructure as Code: Utilize Terraform to define your infrastructure components in a declarative manner. Whether it's virtual machines, databases, or networks, you can specify everything in a Terraform configuration file.

Automate Deployment: Set up GitHub Actions workflows to automatically deploy your infrastructure whenever there are changes to your Terraform configuration. This ensures that your infrastructure stays up to date with your codebase without manual intervention.

Version Control: Keep your infrastructure code version-controlled alongside your application code. By storing your Terraform configurations in version control, such as GitHub, you can easily collaborate with your team, track changes, and roll back to previous versions if needed.

Infrastructure as Code Best Practices: Follow best practices for infrastructure as code development, including versioning, code review, and documentation. This project encourages a structured approach to managing infrastructure, making it more scalable, reliable, and maintainable.
